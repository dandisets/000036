description: 'Despite significant progress in understanding neural coding, it remains
  unclear how the coordinated activity of large populations of neurons relates to
  what an observer actually perceives. Since neurophysiological differences must underlie
  differences among percepts, differentiation analysis-quantifying distinct patterns
  of neurophysiological activity-has been proposed as an "inside-out" approach that
  addresses this question. This methodology contrasts with "outside-in" approaches
  such as feature tuning and decoding analyses, which are defined in terms of extrinsic
  experimental variables. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging in mice of both
  sexes to systematically survey stimulus-evoked neurophysiological differentiation
  (ND) in excitatory neuronal populations in layers (L)2/3, L4, and L5 across five
  visual cortical areas (primary, lateromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, and
  anteromedial) in response to naturalistic and phase-scrambled movie stimuli. We
  find that unscrambled stimuli evoke greater ND than scrambled stimuli specifically
  in L2/3 of the anterolateral and anteromedial areas, and that this effect is modulated
  by arousal state and locomotion. By contrast, decoding performance was far above
  chance and did not vary substantially across areas and layers. Differentiation also
  differed within the unscrambled stimulus set, suggesting that differentiation analysis
  may be used to probe the ethological relevance of individual stimuli.
